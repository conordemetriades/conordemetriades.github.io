    <h2>It's such a nice triangle tbh...</h2>
    <p>So. How to acquire such a splendid shape? Well, first you have to look <em><strong>deep</strong></em> inside yourself and search for that little nugget of yourself that pertains to the more triagonal aspects of the universe. From there you can extrapolate that the sum of all things must be equal to that of the postman. <br><br> Fast and furiously he travels from door to door stealing your energy and eating our children. It must stop. I have imprisoned several postmen over the years inside triangles such as the one above. It's a simple matter really but many often misunderstand why I do it. I'm not insane. I'm a hero in a world that's gone to the aubergines. <br> <br>This is Macho Man Randy Savage signing off.</p>
